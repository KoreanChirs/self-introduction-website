      <div class="goal-description">
        <p>
          In the past, I used to live with one-time goals like 'I need to get a good job' or 'I need to publish papers.' However, as I went through life, what I realized was that these kinds of one-time goals felt very empty once I achieved them. Since then, I've come to understand that what I should pursue in life isn't these one-time goals, but rather my own philosophy about what kind of mindset I should maintain throughout my lifetime. So now my goals are: 'giving people lots of compliments,' 'truly trying to understand other people's lives,' 'having fun doing research while respecting each other with people of similar abilities,' and 'building a happy family and becoming a warm father who can be respected by my children.
